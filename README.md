<img align="left" width="300" border="5" src="travel_buddy_preview.png">

Created using source code from [Data Flair](https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-chatbot-project/)

This generative chatbot uses an LSTM network to detect user intent and produce an appropriate response, including travel tips and current weather information. It also has a GUI (in progress).

Uses OpenWeather API for current weather information and Amdoren API for time zone information.








**Goals**:
 - Allow follow-up response for weather and time queries
 - Finish customizing GUI
 
**Later**:
 - Use weather/time info to give more specific tips
 - Give travel tips specific to locations
 - Give recommendations of specific places to go (restaurants, attractions, etc.)

**Primary tools used:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NLTK, SpaCy, tKinter
